    "introduction": "Hi! My name is Cleriston and I'm a web and mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. Throughout my career, I've developed various projects ranging from mobile apps to complex web platforms.",
    "skills": "Currently, I develop applications in <1>Java</1> (backend) and <1>JavaScript</1> (frontend), as well as <1>HTML</1> and <1>CSS</1>. I love working with modern technologies like <1>React, TypeScript</1> and <1>Spring Boot</1>, and I am always learning and improving my skills. I also develop mobile applications with <1>Ionic</1> and <1>Jetpack Compose (Kotlin)</1>.",
    "background": "I've always had an affinity for IT, even though I started my career in the port industry. Even as a Naval Technical Inspector, I was also responsible for assembling and maintaining computers, LAN networks, and developing administrative solutions. I decided to change careers and dedicate myself to the area that always caught my attention and that aligns more with my vocation.",
    "experience": "With the knowledge acquired, I developed the website of the company where I work. In addition, over the past 5 years, I've had the opportunity to work as a freelancer, which has allowed me to collaborate with a variety of clients and companies. I enjoy the challenge of understanding each client's needs and transforming those needs into a functional and well-presented product.",
