I also develop mobile applications with <6>Ionic</6> and <7>Jetpack Compose (Kotlin)</7>.",
    "background": "I've always had an affinity for IT, even though I started my career in the port industry.

I decided to change careers and dedicate myself to the area that always caught my attention and that aligns more with my vocation.",
    "experience": "With the knowledge acquired, I developed the website of the company where I work. In addition, over the past 5 years, I've had the opportunity to work as a freelancer, which has allowed me to collaborate with a variety of clients and companies. I enjoy the challenge of understanding each client's needs and transforming those needs into a functional and well-presented product.",
